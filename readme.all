Case 3: use sh shell script to build
Command: /bin/sh
Arguments: maven_build.sh


Case 4: use bash shell script to build

pipeline runs seems not finished(in yellow) because the container started and not finished, maybe need to run in background)
curl http://localhost:8080/books  //works
ifconfig: get 192.168.40.135

docker ps
